Pitchfork reviews span many genres, but if the majority of readers favor specific genres, it stands to reason that these genres may receive higher ratings on average. It is also worth noting that the most recent review in this data set is nine years old, making any conclusions potentially outdated. "

Can we see this intuitive trend reflected in the average rating given by Pitchfork authors each month? Alternatively, will we see trends that follow more closely with the typical artist release schedule? It may even be the case that the highest rated months would be those with the fewest new releases, as this is when authors would be more likely to review their old favorites. In that case, we can expect peaks during the holidays and in late winter to spring. "
